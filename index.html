                        <p class="subtitle">November 2020</p>
                        <p>As part of my Web Systems Programming (CSE 264) course in the fall semester 
                            of 2020, my classmates and I were tasked with building a Blackjack web application. 
                            The assignment was a test of our understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and 
                            required us to use a Deck of Cards API to manage the deck, animations for the 
                            cards, and an opponent that operated based on a set of rules given by the professor. 
                            The full web app version can be found in my CS Classwork repository on GitHub, which 
                            is also linked to the "Projects" section of my website. The "Play Blackjack"

                        <p class="subtitle">March 2020 - April 2020</p>
                        <p>In the Spring of 2020, a group of fellow IBE students and I participated in the 
                            Johnson & Johnson University Case Competition. In the given fictional scenario, 
                            we were a team at Johnson & Johnson tasked with deciding the logistics of the 
                            acquisition of a small, research-oriented company. Our decisions involved which 
                            of three companies to choose from, when to buy them, which projects to adopt, 
                            which marketing strategies to pursue, and more. Each decision had a financial 
                            impact that could be seen in a provided interactive Excel worksheet showing the 
                            project's cash flows, net present value, and other metrics. Our decisions had 
                            to provide a financially sound project, adequate product market share, and 
                            consistency with the company credo. After taking time to discuss each decision, 
                            our team found a strategy that balanced each aspect of the project nicely. 
                            After presenting our plan to the judges, we were given "a close second" place 
                            in the competition. This experience offered insight into corporate finance 
                            decision-making, helped me develop my teamwork skills through our groupâ€™s 
                            involved discussions, and reminded me about the effectiveness of a team with 
                            diverse thought processes.

                            like Java and C among others. Using the link below, visit my GitHub portfolio, 
                            which contains many of my computer science and computer/electrical engineering

                        <p class="subtitle">August 2020 - December 2020</p>
                        <p>In the Fall of 2020, I took an IBE course that involved learning how to use 
                            Microsoft Excel for optimization and modeling in a varitey of business 
                            applications. We were then able to directly apply these concepts in the second 
                            part of the course: a business simulation game. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The business game involved our class forming 12 teams, or companies, that would 
                            compete for the largest amount of net assets by the end of the semester. 
                            Every team started with the identical assets and were in direct competition 
                            with each other, selling identical units. Each week, all of the teams decided 
                            how to price units across 12 cities, whether we want to build new plants or 
                            warehouses, and how to invest our cash, whether itâ€™s buying stocks in other 
                            companies, certificates of deposit, cost control programs, adversitzing, and 
                            R&D. 
                        </p>
                        <p>My team took a conservative approach thoughout the game by keeping 
                            moderate prices, safe stock investments, and inventory. We used some of the 
                            optimization strategies we learned in class to aid in certain decisions, such 
                            as our weekly pricing strategy. In the trial run of the simulation, our team 
                            placed first, and in the real simulation, we placed third. Our moderate strategy 
                            was rewarding and proved the effectiveness of a well-thought and analyzed plan.

                        <p class="subtitle">November 2020 - December 2020</p>
                        <p>For the final project of my Web Systems Programming (CSE 264) course, a group 
                            of students and I developed Hawk Messenger, a web application for messaging 
                            other Lehigh students. When a user opens the page, they are prompted for their 
                            name. If a conversation is in progress, the user is able to view all previous 
                            messages in the current discussion, which are stored in and populated from a 
                            database. When all users leave, the database is cleared of all messages. To 
                            initiate a conversation, any user may press "send" without typing, which will 
                            send a random joke from an API. The application uses socket.io, Node.js, 
                            Express.js, Mongoose.js, and MongoDB. Feel free to try it at the link below.

                        <h3>IBE Freshman Workshop</h3>
                        <p class="subtitle">January 2019 - May 2019</p>
                        <p>During my freshman year, I took an IBE-specific course that discussed fundamentals 
                            of entrepreneurship. Over the last seven weeks of the course, our class was split 
                            into groups and tasked with developing a product to solve some kind of problem. 
                            For example, my group had to design a product that would effectively remove snow 
                            and ice from the cars of daily commuters the morning after a snowstorm. The seven-week-long 
                            project involved talking with our target customers, industry professionals, possible 
                            manufacturers, Lehigh professors, and others to ultimately design a prototype and 
                            business plan to bring the product to market. We then presented this product and plan 
                            to professors, peers, and family.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our original design for the product resembled a small snowblower that the user could 
                            move over the top of their car; however, we realized that this design was not realistic 
                            for a number of reasons, such as power consumption and usability. After trying to find 
                            ways to work around our problems, we realized we needed a completely new design. I 
                            mention this design pivot because learning that it is sometimes necessary to change 
                            direction entirely for the best overall outcome was one of the biggest lessons that 
                            I learned while working on the project. 
                        </p>
                        <p>We named our final product Avalanche. This snow shovel shown in the image below came 
                            with a number of features that make it effective. Its shape as shown is ideal for pushing 
                            snow off a car. The square face can also be rotated parallel to the shaft and turn 
                            the device into a shovel for digging a car out of a snow pile. The handle can be taken 
                            out to reveal a pointed end used for breaking up ice. Also, the user can attach a 
                            "de-icing" slip to a roller at the base of the square face to help melt stuck-on ice. 
                        </p>
                        <p>This project was very involved, and I enjoyed getting the hands-on experience of 
                            working through an entrepreneurial process. It was a great exercise to understand 
                            much of what goes into starting a business. Many of the skills I developed and insights 
                            I gathered while working on this project I will carry with me throughout my professional 
                            career.

                        <p>Alongside my coursework in the summer of 2020, I decided to teach myself HTML and CSS 
                            in order to build a personal website. While building the site, I found a real interest 
                            in web development. I decided to pursue it further by taking a web systems course the 
                            following semester. After this course, I decided to have another attempt at a personal 
                            website, which is what you are currently using. In the spirit of reflecting on growth, 
                            I decided to link my previous website below. The website linked here was published until 
                            January 2021.
